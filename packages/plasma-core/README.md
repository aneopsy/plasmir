`plasma-core` is the **core** of Plasma Group's client functionality.
`plasma-core` is **not** designed to be a full plasma client.
As a result, `plasma-core` does not provide a graphical user interface or an easy way to interact with components.
If you're looking for a full client, check out [`plasma-client`](https://github.com/plasma-group/plasma-client) or [`plasma-extension`](https://github.com/plasma-group/plasma-extension)
